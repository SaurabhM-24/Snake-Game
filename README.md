# Snake-Game
This is the retro Snake Game recreated using python-pygame library. One can use this code to relive thier memories and gain basic insights of pygame module.


This is the classic snake game that I have tried to recreate here, using the Pygame library that can be used to learn the fundamentals of game development. The code is available along with the .exe file for the ease of access.

System Requirements -
Python 3.8+
Pygame 2.0+

No other system requirements are there in my knowledge.
